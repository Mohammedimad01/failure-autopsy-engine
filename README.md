# Failure Autopsy Engine (FAE)
AI-powered diagnostic system for analysing why applications fail and generating structured improvement feedback with predictive success estimation.

# Overview

Failure Autopsy Engine (FAE) is an AI-driven evaluation support system designed to identify the root causes behind rejected applications and provide structured guidance for improvement.

Traditional evaluation systems only deliver binary outcomes — accepted or rejected — without explaining failure patterns. FAE introduces an analytical framework that diagnoses decision factors, compares submissions against successful benchmarks, and generates actionable feedback to improve future outcomes.

The system is designed for scalable evaluation environments such as:
grant applications  
academic admissions  
hiring processes  
funding proposals  
competition submissions  

FAE transforms evaluation from outcome reporting to decision intelligence.

# Problem Statement

Most application review systems lack transparency and structured feedback. Applicants receive rejection decisions without understanding:
which evaluation criteria were not met  
how their submission differs from successful cases  
what specific improvements are required  

This creates inefficiency, frustration, and repeated failure cycles.

FAE addresses this by analysing submission content, comparing it with successful benchmarks, and identifying improvement pathways using AI-assisted reasoning.

# Key Features
Root cause analysis of rejected applications  
Semantic comparison with successful submissions  
AI-generated structured feedback  
Severity scoring of weaknesses  
Predictive success estimation  
Scalable evaluation architecture  

# System Architecture

The system is designed as a modular analytical pipeline:

1. Document ingestion and preprocessing  
2. Semantic embedding generation  
3. Vector similarity search against benchmark database (FAISS)  
4. Pattern and gap identification  
5. AI-driven feedback generation using large language models  
6. Predictive scoring and recommendation output  

This pipeline enables consistent, explainable evaluation support.
